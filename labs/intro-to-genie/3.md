## Step 3. Define your Genie Testbed

Before we get started, we must tell Genie which devices we are running our tests against. This is called a `testbed` file.

For more infromation on PyATS & Genie testbeds, you can refer to the [Topology Documentation](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats/docs/topology/introduction.html)


1. Generate a testbed file for your simulation

```
virl generate pyats
```

2. Examine the testbed file

```
cat default_testbed.yaml
```

The testbed file is a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) (“Yet Another Markup Language”); it is a data serialization format that is designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable. YAML is indentation & white space sensitive. Its syntax maps directly to most common datastructures in Python, such dict, list, str etc.

Your testbed file contains definitions of various things in the environment such as routers, switches, links, external servers, or traffic generators.

For the newly launched testbed, the NX-OSv router defintion would look like this:

```
devices:
  nx-osv-1: <--- device name
    alias: nx-osv-1 <--- alias used by Genie to refer to this device
    type: NX-OSv
    connections:

      defaults:
        class: unicon.Unicon
      console:
        protocol: telnet
        port: 17040
        ip: 172.25.192.90
```

A more comprehensive testbed sample can be found

    here
  </a>
you should take a few minutes to review some of the additional options that can be configured for a given testbed.

3. Edit the testbed file to modify the `alias` for each device in the topology. Genie will use this `alias` to refer to devices in the testbed during test execution.

```
devices:
  nx-osv-1:
    alias: 'uut' <--- changed from 'nx-osv-1'
    type: NX-OSv

...

  csr1000v-1:
    alias: 'helper' <--- changed from 'csr1000v-1'
    type: CSR1000v
```
