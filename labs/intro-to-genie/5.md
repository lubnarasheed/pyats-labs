## Step 5. Using Genie to connect to a device


1. Create a new file genie_connect.robot

```
cd genie_tests
touch genie_connect.robot
```


2. Edit the file genie_connect.robot and copy the code below into it

````
# Example
# -------
# Genie Devnet Lab-1: Connect to a device using CLI and XML

*** Settings ***
Library        pyats.robot.pyATSRobot
Library        genie.libs.robot.GenieRobot
Library        unicon.robot.UniconRobot

*** Variables ***
# Defining variables that can be used elsewhere in the test data.
${testbed}     /genie_tests/default_testbed.yaml

*** TestCases ***
# Creating testcases from available Genie keywords

# Connect to a device using CLI as the communication protocol
connect to device with CLI
    use genie testbed "${testbed}"
    connect to devices "uut"
````

This is a simple script to connect to the `uut` device using via CLI using Genie. Take a few minutes to review the script above including the library imports. The overall script can be broken down into 3 main sections:

- Libraries:

We define the libraries at the top of the script that are needed to for Genie/PyATS/Unicon RobotFramework:

* `pyats.robot.pyATSRobot`:
	- Used run pyATS AEtest testcases using specific PyATS Robot keywords and converting results to Robot
	- Also used to load and use pyATS testbed topology YAML files

* `genie.libs.robot.GenieRobot`:
	- Used to run Genie Triggers & Verifications using specific Genie Robot keywords and convert the results to Robot
	- In this example however, we are only demonstrating how to connect to a device

* `unicon.robot.UniconRobot`:
	- Used to connect to a device and execute/configure commands using specific Unicon Robot keywords

- Variables

The next section contains variables that will be referenced by the testcases below. In the example above, we define the `testbed` variable to be used by the testcases below.

- TestCases

In this section we add testcases based on a combination of Genie, PyATS and Unicon Robot Keywords.


3. Run this script by executing the following command and examine the output:

```
(pyats)$ robot genie_connect.robot
=============================================================================
Pyats                                                                         
=============================================================================
connect to device with CLI                                           | PASS |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pyats                                                                | PASS |
1 critical tests, 1 passed, 0 failed
1 test total, 1 passed, 0 failed
=============================================================================
Output:  /current/dir/output.xml
Log:     /current/dir/log.html
Report:  /current/dir/report.html
```

The log.html file can be viewed using any browser and contains detailed step-by-step logs of each test executed:

The report.hml file can be viewed with any browser and contains a summary of the tests executed:

4. Lets add one more testcase to connect to the `uut` device using via XML using Genie. 

Edit the file genie_connect.robot again and add the following lines of code to the bottom of the file.

````
# Connect to the device using XML
connect to device with XML
    use genie testbed "${testbed}"
    connect to devices "uut" via "xml"
````


5. Run the script again and examine the output

```
(pyats)$ robot genie_connect.robot
=============================================================================
Pyats                                                                         
=============================================================================
connect to device with CLI                                           | PASS |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
connect to device with XML                                           | PASS |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pyats                                                                | PASS |
2 critical tests, 2 passed, 0 failed
2 tests total, 2 passed, 0 failed
=============================================================================
Output:  /current/dir/output.xml
Log:     /current/dir/log.html
Report:  /current/dir/report.html
```


As seen above, it is simple to change the `context` or communication protocol with which we can connect to a device. Genie supports connecting to a device with a multitude of communication protocols such as CLI, XML, NETCONF, REST etc.
