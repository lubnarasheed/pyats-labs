## Step 7. Execute Genie script with Easypy


0. Activate your Python virtual environment

[Option] Run Docker container and activate your Python virtual environment inside it

```
# Run Docker container
[developer@devbox ~]$ docker run -it -v ~/genie_learning_lab:/root/genie_learning_lab ciscotestautomation/pyats:latest-robot /bin/bash

# Activate Python virtual environment
root@152b1e2e50a1:/pyats# source /pyats/bin/activate
```
- OR -

[Option] Activate Python virtual environment directly on DevNet Sandbox

```
# Activate Python virtual environment
[developer@devbox ~]$ source ~/pyats/bin/activate
```

> Note: The commands above have been executed within the `intro-to-genie` lab in Step #4 and don't need to be repeated if previously completed.


1. Navigate to the genie_learning_lab folder and view the script `genie_sample_job.py`

```
cd ~/genie_learning_lab
cat genie_sample_job.py
```


2. Examine the contents of the script `genie_sample_job.py`

```python
'''
Sample Genie Job File
'''

# Author
__author__ = 'Cisco Systems Inc.'
__copyright__ = 'Copyright (c) 2018, Cisco Systems Inc.'
__contact__ = ['asg-genie-support@cisco.com']
__date__= 'January 2019'


# ATS & Genie
from ats.datastructures.logic import And, Not, Or
from genie.harness.main import gRun


def main(runtime):

    gRun(mapping_datafile='mapping_datafile.yaml',
         trigger_uids=And('TriggerDisableEnableBgp\.'),
         verification_uids=And('Verify_BgpAllNexthopDatabase\.'),
         )
```

Review the Genie job file above and note the following components of the script:

- `gRun`

A pyATS script is derived from the information provided to the Genie Harness with gRun. The mapping file is the only mandatory argument provided to Genie.

Executing gRun launches Genie Harness to execute the pre-defined subsections in sequence: namely the common_setup, Verifications, Triggers, common_cleanup. Each subsection performs unique tasks such as connecting to devices, applying configuration, executing triggers and verifications etc. Users can control which subsections to run using the `subsection_datafile` argument.

For more information refer to the [Genie Harness Guide](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/harness/user/gettingstarted.html)

- `mapping_datafile`

The pyATS testbed YAML file contains the testbed topology and ALL of the testbedâ€™s devices. Any given device in the testbed topology can be configured to support various connection protocols such as: Console, Network Mangement VTY, NETCONF(YANG), and more in the future. These communication protocol names are not standardized, hence Genie cannot know which one to use for which context.

The mapping_datafile allows for this mapping to happen seamlessly. The mapping_datafile argument is a YAML file that is used by Genie Harness to identify which devices from the testbed YAML the script should connect to, as well as which communication protocol to use when connecting to those devices.

- `trigger_uids`

By default, all Triggers in `genie.libs.sdk` are available for execution using Genie Harness. The trigger_uids argument is used to specify which Triggers we would like to execute using Genie Harness.

- `verification_uids`

By default, all Verification developed in `genie.libs.sdk` are available for execution using Genie Harness. The verification_uids argument is used to specify which Verifications we would like to execute using Genie Harness before and after each Trigger.

- And, Or, Not Objects

pyATS provides logical operators that can be used to standardize how to represent and evaluate logical expressions within the scope of pyATS and Genie. Users can specify exactly which triggers and verifications to use by providing a "logical expression" object to the `trigger_uids` and `verification_uids` arguments as seen above. 

For more details, please refer to the [Logic Testing](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats/docs/datastructures/logic.html) documentation.

List of arguments supported by Genie Harness [gRun arguments](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/harness/user/reference.html)


3. Examine the contents of the `mapping_datafile.yaml` located under /genie_tests

```yaml
devices:
  nx-osv-1:
    context: cli
    label: uut
    mapping:
      cli: console
```

In the above example, we are mapping the console connection to be used for CLI. The device name can either be the hostname of the device defined in the testbed file, or the device alias. Note that aliases must be unique for for each device.

To launch or run the job above, we need to "execute" the job using the Easypy launcher.

- What is Easypy?

Easypy provides a standardized runtime environment for testscript execution in pyATS. It offers a simple, straight-forward way for users to aggregate testscripts together into jobs, integrates various pyATS modules together into a collectively managed ecosystem, and archives all resulting information for post-mortem debugging.

Easypy comes prepackaged with several useful features such as:

* Aggregation of multiple testscripts into one `job`
* Stores all runtime log outputs to a TaskLog
* Emails the user result information upon finishing
* Executes each jobfile Task in a child process, and configures the environment to allow for hands-off forking
* Capable of booting devices in a testbed with a new image
* Extendable plugin-based execution implemetation, allowing for custom user created injections

For more information, refer to the [Easypy Documentation](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats/docs/easypy/index.html)


4. Execute the script using Easypy

```
cd ~/genie_learning_lab
easypy genie_sample_job.py -testbed_file default_testbed.yaml -html_logs
```

View output of test execution on your terminal
