# Step 1. Genie Harness and Genie Robot


This module will introduce the reader to the concept of Genie Triggers and Genie Verifications. It will then explain how to create Genie scripts by combining Triggers and Verifications and how to execute those scripts using Robot and Easypy.


## Objectives

In this learning lab you are going to:

* Learn about Genie Triggers and Verifications
* Review the readily available Triggers and Verifications in Genie Libs Package
* Execute Genie Triggers
* Execute Genie Verifications
* Create a Genie script using a combination of Triggers & Verifications
* Execute a Genie script with Robot
* Execute a Genie script with Easypy


## Prerequisites

1. Successfully completed lab [intro-to-genie](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/pyats-labs/tree/master/labs/intro-to-genie)
2. Successfully completed lab [parsers-with-genie](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/pyats-labs/tree/master/labs/parsers-with-genie)


## Running with Genie Robot

[RobotFramework](http://robotframework.org/) is a generic Python/Java test automation framework that focuses on acceptance test automation using English-like easy-to-use `keywords` to define testcases. Robot's testing capabilities can be extended by creating new higher-level `keywords` from existing ones that use the same syntax.

Genie, pyATS and Unicon packages have been enhanced to support `keywords` that can be used with RobotFramework. These `keywords` have been made available through the optional robot sub-package `genie.libs.robot` under the `genie.libs` namespace umbrella and the `pyats.robot` sub-package under pyATS. This enables RobotFramework users to leverage key aspects of Genie and pyATS without having to reinvent the wheel.

* Supported Robot Keywords:
	- [Genie Robot Keywords](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/robot.html)
	- [pyATS Robot Keywords](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats/docs/robot.html)
	- [Unicon Robot Keywords](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/unicon/robot.html)

* Documentation:
	- [Genie Robot Documentation](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/robot/index.html)
	- [pyATS Robot Documentation](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats/docs/robot/index.html)
	- [Unicon Robot Documentation](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/unicon/robot/index.html)

As seen in previous Genie Labs, by choosing a combination of Genie Triggers and Verifications to be run in specific sequence, a user can create a Genie `script` from scratch using Genie Robot keywords.


## Running with Genie Harness

With the Genie test harness, the concept of event driven testing is introduced into the pyATS framework. With event driven testing, script and testcases are derived dynamically based on selected triggers and verification from the Genie SDK pool. Using the Genie test harness, automation becomes focused primarily on developping targeted test scenarios where the action is handled in the trigger and what needs to be verified before and after the trigger in verification.

For extensive details on getting started with using Genie Harness:
- [Genie Harness Guide](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/harness/index.html)

The package `genie.harness` is automatically installed upon executing `pip install genie`. To install this package standalone, execute:

```
pip install genie.harness --upgrade
```
