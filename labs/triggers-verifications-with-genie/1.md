# Step 1. Genie Triggers and Verifications

This module will introduce the reader to the concept of Genie Triggers and Verifications.

## Objectives

In this learning lab you are going to:

* Learn about Genie Triggers and Verifications
* Review the readily available Triggers and Verifications in Genie Libs Package
* Execute Genie Triggers
* Execute Genie Verifications

## Prerequisites

1. Python virtual environment
2. Completed lab [intro-to-pyats](https://github.com/kecorbin/pyats-labs/tree/master/labs/intro-to-pyats) 
3. Completed lab [boot-genie-virl](https://github.com/kecorbin/pyats-labs/tree/master/labs/)
4. VIRL testbed and testbed YAML file (/path/to/virl.yaml needed for examples)
5. Completed lab [intro-to-genie](https://github.com/kecorbin/pyats-labs/tree/master/labs/)

## Genie Triggers

A Genie trigger is a set of actions that collectively constitute a testcase. These actions can include removal/addition of configuration, flapping protocols/interfaces, unconfiguring/configuring protocols, executing HA commands such as device reload/switchover/ISSU, and any other actions that can be performed on a device.

Genie provides several pre-built Triggers that can be leveraged to test your network device within the `genie.libs.sdk` package

## Genie Verifications

A Genie verification is the execution of a show command to retrieve the current state of a device. Verifications could be CLI show commands, XML commands, NETCONF RPC requests, REST calls, and so on. Verifications can be run standalone in scripts. Alternatively, they can be run in combination with Genie Triggers to create tailor made testcases.

## Installation

Genie Triggers and Verifications can be found in the `genie.libs.sdk` package which is automatically installed when executing `pip install genie`. To install this package standalone, execute:

```
pip install genie.libs.sdk
```

## Available Genie Triggers and Verifications

Genie Triggers and Verifications are open sourced and hosted on GitHub:
- [Genie Triggers GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/genielibs/tree/master/pkgs/sdk-pkg/src/genie/libs/sdk/triggers)
- [Genie Verifications GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/genielibs/blob/master/pkgs/sdk-pkg/genie_yamls/verification_datafile.yaml)
