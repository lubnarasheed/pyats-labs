## Step 4. Genie Verifications


### Genie Verifications

A Genie verification is the execution of a show command to retrieve the current state of a device. Verifications could be CLI show commands, XML commands, NETCONF RPC requests, REST calls, and so on. Verifications can be run standalone in scripts. Alternatively, they can be run in combination with Genie Triggers to create tailor made testcases.

Genie Verifications are open sourced and hosted on GitHub:
- [Genie Verifications GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/genielibs/blob/master/pkgs/sdk-pkg/genie_yamls/verification_datafile.yaml)

List of verifications available within the `genie.libs.sdk` package:

### Install Genie Libs Sdk

Genie Triggers and Verifications can be found in the `genie.libs.sdk` package which is automatically installed when executing `pip install genie`. To install this package standalone, execute:

```
pip install genie.libs.sdk
```
