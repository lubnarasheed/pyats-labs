## Step 3. Execute Genie Triggers


0. Activate your Python virtual environment

[Option] Run Docker container and activate your Python virtual environment inside it

```
# Run Docker container
[developer@devbox ~]$ docker run -it -v ~/genie_learning_lab:/root/genie_learning_lab ciscotestautomation/pyats:latest-robot /bin/bash

# Activate Python virtual environment
root@152b1e2e50a1:/pyats# source /pyats/bin/activate
```
- OR -

[Option] Activate Python virtual environment directly on DevNet Sandbox

```
# Activate Python virtual environment
[developer@devbox ~]$ source ~/pyats/bin/activate
```

> Note: The commands above have been executed within the `intro-to-genie` lab in Step #4 and don't need to be repeated if previously completed.


1. Navigate to the genie_learning_lab folder and view the script `genie_triggers.robot`

```
cd ~/genie_learning_lab
cat genie_triggers.robot
```


2. Examine the contents of the script `genie_triggers.robot`

```
# Genie Devnet Lab-3a: Execute Genie Triggers
# ===========================================


*** Settings ***
Library        ats.robot.pyATSRobot
Library        genie.libs.robot.GenieRobot
Library        unicon.robot.UniconRobot


*** Variables ***
# Defining variables that can be used elsewhere in the test data.
${testbed}     default_testbed.yaml


*** Test Cases ***
# Creating testcases using available Genie, pyATS & Unicon keywords


# Connect to UUT device using CLI
connect to UUT device
    use genie testbed "${testbed}"
    connect to devices "uut"


# Trigger-1: TriggerShutNoShutBgp
#    1. Connects to UUT device, checks if BGP configuration is present and learns BGP configuration
#    2. Configures 'shutdown' under BGP instance to shutdown BGP
#    3. Verifies BGP instance and BGP neighbors are in 'shutdown' state
#    4. Configures 'no shutdown' under BGP instance
#    5. Verifies BGP instance and BGP neighbors are back up
#
execute TriggerShutNoShutBgp
    run trigger "TriggerShutNoShutBgp" on device "uut"


# Trigger-2: TriggerUnconfigConfigBgp
#    1. Connects to UUT device, checks if BGP configuration is present, learns BGP configuration and creates a checkpoint
#    2. Configures 'no router bgp <instance>' to remove BGP configuration
#    3. Verifies BGP instance and BGP neighbors are removed from configuration
#    4. Restores configuration back to checkpoint stored in Step #1
#    5. Verifies BGP configuration is restored and BGP neighbors are established
#
execute TriggerUnconfigConfigBgp
    run trigger "TriggerUnconfigConfigBgp" on device "uut"

```

This is a sample script to execute a `Trigger` on a device using Genie.

Note that we don't specify the device type or operating system when executing the Genie `Trigger`. This is because the package `genie.abstract` uses abstraction based on the device operating system to dynamically "lookup" which OS libraries it would need to load for the trigger (ex: Cisco NX or Cisco XE).

For more information on Abstract and Lookup, in Genie refer to the documentation below:
- [Genie Abstract](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/abstract/introduction.html)
- [Genie Lookup](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/abstract/lookup_class.html)

The following is a list of all the Triggers (for each OS) available within the `genie.libs.sdk` package that can be executed in the manner shown above:
- [Genie Trigger List](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/genie_libs/#/triggers)


3. Run this script by executing the following command

```
cd ~/genie_learning_lab
robot genie_triggers.robot
```

Examine the output to see testcase results, HTML log report and XML output
