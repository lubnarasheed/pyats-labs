## Step 2. Genie Triggers


### Genie Triggers

A Genie trigger is a sequence of actions that can be executed or configured on a device which collectively constitute a testcase. These actions can include removal/addition of configuration, flapping protocols/interfaces, unconfiguring/configuring protocols, executing HA commands such as device reload/switchover/ISSU, and any other actions that can be performed on a device.

Genie provides several pre-built Triggers that can be leveraged to test your network device within the `genie.libs.sdk` package.

Genie Triggers are open sourced and hosted on GitHub:
