## Step 3. Define your pyATS Testbed

Before we can run our test suite, we must tell pyATS what devices we are running
our tests against.  This is called a `testbed` file.

For more infromation on pyATS testbeds and topologies you can vist [here](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats/docs/topology/introduction.html)



1. Generate a testbed file for your simulation
  ```
  virl generate pyats
  ```

1. Examine the testbed file

  ```
  cat default_testbed.yaml
  ```

  The testbed file is a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) (short for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”
  or “Yet Another Markup Language”), is a human-readable data serialization format that is designed to be both
  human readable and machine readable.

  YAML is indentation & white space sensitive. Its syntax maps directly to most common
  datastructures in Python, such dict, list, str etc.

  Your testbed file contains definitions of various things in the environment routers, switches, links,
  external servers, or traffic generators.

  A simple definition of a router might look like

  ```
  devices:

    ios1: <-- device name
      alias: ios1
      connections:

        defaults:
          class: unicon.Unicon  
        console:
          ip: 10.10.20.160  
          protocol: telnet
          port: 17000
  ```

  A more comprehensive testbed sample can be found

  here
  </a>
  you should take a few minutes to review some of the additional options that can be configured for a given testbed.
