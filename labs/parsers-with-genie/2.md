## Step 2. Execute Genie Parsers


0. Activate your Python virtual environment

[Option] Run Docker container and activate your Python virtual environment inside it

```
# Run Docker container
[developer@devbox ~]$ docker run -it -v ~/genie_learning_lab:/root/genie_learning_lab ciscotestautomation/pyats:latest-robot /bin/bash

# Activate Python virtual environment
root@152b1e2e50a1:/pyats# source /pyats/bin/activate
```
- OR -

[Option] Activate Python virtual environment directly on DevNet Sandbox

```
# Activate Python virtual environment
[developer@devbox ~]$ source ~/pyats/bin/activate
```

> Note: The commands above have been executed within the `intro-to-genie` lab in Step #4 and don't need to be repeated if previously completed.


1. Navigate to the genie_learning_lab folder and view the script `genie_parsers.robot`

```
cd ~/genie_learning_lab
cat genie_parsers.robot
```


2. Examine the contents of the script `genie_parsers.robot`

```
# Genie Devnet Lab-2: Execute show commands and parse outputs

*** Settings ***
Library        ats.robot.pyATSRobot
Library        genie.libs.robot.GenieRobot
Library        unicon.robot.UniconRobot


*** Variables ***

*** Test Cases ***
# Creating testcases using available Genie, PyATS & Unicon keywords


# Connect to UUT device using CLI
connect to UUT device
    use genie testbed "${testbed}"
    connect to devices "uut"


# Load parser "ShowBgpProcessVrfAll"
# Execute 'show bgp process vrf all'
# Parse the output of the show command using the parser loaded above
execute and parse 'show bgp process vrf all' on UUT
    parse "genie.libs.parser.show_bgp.ShowBgpProcessVrfAll" on device "uut"


# Load parser "ShowModule"
# Execute 'show module'
# Parse the output of the show command using the parser loaded above
execute and parse 'show platform' on UUT
    parse "genie.libs.parser.show_platform.ShowModule" on device "uut"

```

This is a sample script to execute show commands on a device and parse the output into script-readable Python datastructures using Genie.

Note that we don't specify the device type or operating system when executing the Genie parser. This is because the package `genie.abstract` uses abstraction based on the device operating system to dynamically "lookup" which OS libraries it would need to load for the parser (ex: Cisco NX or Cisco XE).

For more information on Abstract and Lookup, in Genie refer to the documentation below:
- [Genie Abstract](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/abstract/introduction.html)
- [Genie Lookup](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/abstract/lookup_class.html)

For a list of parsers available within the `genie.libs.parser` package package that can be executed in the manner shown above:

3. Run this script by executing the following command

```
cd ~/genie_learning_lab
robot genie_parsers.robot
```

Examine the output to see testcase results, HTML log report and XML output

4. Let's take a look at how we can determine the Python parser for a parser

Let's navigate to the [Genie Parsers Repo](https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/genieparser) on GitHub and walk through the directory structure to determine how the directory structure/filenames/class names would map to the Genie parser library import as seen in the script above.

	- Click on src/genie to navigate to this folder
	- Click on libs/ to navigate to this foldder
	- Click on parsers/ to navigate to this folder

You should see the files/directories as outlined below:

```
 iosxe
 iosxr
 nxos
 template
 utils
 yang
 __init__.py
 base.py
```

As seen above, we followed through folder path "src/genie/libs/parser" under the genieparser repo. This in turn corresponds to the first part of our parser's Python library import `genie.libs.parser`. The Genie infra already knows which operating system we need (in this example: Cisco NXOS).

Click on the "nxos" folder to see what files (parsers) are available for Cisco NXOS:

```
 __init__.py
 show_arp.py
 show_bgp.py          <<<<< Sample Python file containing parser class ShowBgpProcessVrfAll
 show_feature.py
 show_hsrp.py
 show_interface.py
 show_mcast.py
 show_ospf.py
 show_platform.py     <<<<< Sample Python file containing parser class ShowModule
```

Click on the Python file [show_bgp.py](https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/genieparser/blob/master/src/genie/libs/parser/nxos/show_bgp.py). At the top of the file you will see a list of all the BGP related show commands that can be parsed by the parser classes within this file.

Search for the Python parser class called `ShowBgpProcessVrfAll`. This parser class can be used to parse the output of CLI command "show bgp process vrf all" and create a Python datastructure containing the parsed information.

The Python datastructure that will be created by this parser can be found in the class `ShowBgpProcessVrfAllSchema`. As seen in the code, this class inherits from `MetaParser` and defines only the schema/Python datastructure that the parser should create when it parses the CLI/XML/NETCONF RPC output. Therefore, this parser class can also parse the output of XML command "show bpg process vrf all | xml" and the output of NETCONF RPC and create the exact same Python datastructure as the parsed CLI command. This ensures that the Python datastructure obtained after parsing is always the same across all communication protocols (CLI/XML/NETCONF etc). The consistency in the structure across all communication protocols is performed by the `MetaParser` package.

For any feature, the show command output depends on the configuration entered by the user. For this reason, you will notice that someof the keys in the Python datastructure are marked as "Optional" as the are subject to user configuration.

Naviate to the Python file [show_platform.py](https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/genieparser/blob/master/src/genie/libs/parser/nxos/show_platform.py) and seach for the Python parser class `ShowModule` to see how CLI command "show module" is parsed and what it's parsed Python datastructure would look like.

As seen above, we can determine that our Python library imports for the show commands that we want to parse would be:
1. `genie.libs.parser.show_bgp.ShowBgpProcessVrfAll` and
2. `genie.libs.parser.show_platform.ShowModule` respectively.


#### Congratulations! You've Completed Parsers with Genie!
