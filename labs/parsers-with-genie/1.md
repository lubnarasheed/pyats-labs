# Genie MetaParser and Parsers


This module will introduce the reader to the concept of Genie MetaParser and how to use parsers available in the Genie Libs Parser package.


## Objectives

In this learning lab you are going to:

* Learn about Genie MetaParser and Genie Libs Parser
* Installation and Documentation for Genie MetaParser and Genie Libs Parser
* Learn how to contribute back to Genie Libs Parser
* Execute Genie Parsers


## Prerequisites

1. Successfully completed lab [intro-to-genie](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/pyats-labs/tree/master/labs/intro-to-genie) and launched Genie VIRL simulation
2. VIRL testbed YAML available


## Genie MetaParser

There are multiple ways to communicate with a device using different communication protocols such as CLI, XML, NETCONF, REST etc. Each communitcation protocol returns the same device information; however it requires a different input and in turn provides a different structure for each protocol. Parsing is the mechanism of translating and harmonizing device output into Python data structures that can be understood by a script. Parsers are therefore the root of automation; without them, automation cannot understand the device.

The Genie Metaparser package (or simply MetaParser) enables users to homogenize the parsed output into a single structure/schema across multiple communication protocols. In other words, MetaParser provides a mechanism for communication protocol agnosticness to work across multiple OS, protocols and parsing methodologies and solutions.


## High Level Features

- Harmonize parsed output to create consistent parser structure across all communication protocols
- Future-proof and maintainable OS/platform/version agnostic scripts by deferring operational data parsing to back-end libraries
- Enables an elastic parsing ecosystem that is simple enough for the novice but feature-rich enough for the power user


## Install Genie MetaParser

The Genie Metaparser package is automatically installed upon executing 'pip install genie'. To install this pacakge standalone, execute the following:

```
pip install genie.metaparser
```


## MetaParser Documentation

- For detailed documentation on MetaParser refer to this [guide](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/metaparser/index.html).

- For more information on advanced MetaParser usage, refer to this [guide](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/metaparser/advanced/introduction.html#advanced-usage).


## Genie Libs Parsers

- This Genie Libs package contains parsers written using Genie MetaParser to parse device outputs for various CLI/XML/NETCONF commands across different operating systems (Cisco NX, XE, XR).
- All parsers developed for Genie are open source and hosted on GitHub:
	* [Genie Parsers GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/genieparser)


## Install Genie Libs Parser

The Genie Libs Parser package is automatically installed upon executing 'pip install genie'. To install this pacakge standalone, execute the following:

```
pip install genie.libs.parser
```


## Contributing to Parsers

- Since Genie Libs Parsers are open sourced, users can contribute back to this repo. Users need to activate developer mode for the `genie.libs.parser` packaged within their pip installation by following the steps listed [here](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/metaparser/advanced/contribute.html#contribute-to-parser-build).

- Ensure you follow coding guidelines and also create unittests associated with the parser implementation prior to creating a pull request.
