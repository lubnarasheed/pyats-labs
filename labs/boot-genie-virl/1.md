# Introduction to VIRL Simulations

This module is a step-by-step guide to bootup a testbed using VIRL as a prerequisite for Genie Devnet Labs

## Objectives

In this learning lab you are going to:

* Learn about Cisco VIRL
* Launch a VIRL simulation to bootup a testbed
* Create a testbed YAML file (virl.yaml) to be used in the Genie Devnet Labs

## Prerequisites

1. Python virtual environment
2. VIRL License

## What is VIRL?

Cisco Virtual Internet Routing Labs (VIRL) is an extensible network virtualization platform that enables the development of high-fidelity models of real or planned networks.  VIRL includes current virtualized versions of Cisco network operating systems and allows integration with 'real' physical / external networks, network elements, and servers.

It’s your flexible, all-in-one virtual networking lab. No more bulky network equipment and hours of wiring! Easy-to-build connections to actual networking equipment or to extend your lab by linking physical and virtual networking devices.

For detailed information refer to the [VIRL Tutorials](http://virl-dev-innovate.cisco.com/tutorials.php) and also peruse the [Cisco VIRL YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC41WuzXlJCGY5qLsuZ8aHkQ) 

## Launch VIRL Simulation for Genie

Follow the step-by-step [VIRL Bootup Guide](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/examples/virl.html#devnet-user) 

## Create testbed YAML

A testbed file is a YAML (Yet Another Markup Language), is a human-readable data serialization format that is designed to be both human readable and machine readable. YAML is indentation & white space sensitive. Its syntax maps directly to most common datastructures in Python, such dict, list, str etc.

Create a testbed YAML file for your newly launched VIRL testbed as shown below. Ensure you populate the fields marked with "FILL HERE" with the IPs generated during bootup in the previous step. Save this YAML file as `virl.yaml` as it will be referenced throughout the Genie Devnet Labs. 

```yaml
testbed:
    name: 'virl'

devices:
    nx-osv-1:
        type: "NX-OSv 9000"
        os: "nxos"
        alias: uut
        tacacs:
            login_prompt: 'login:'
            password_prompt: 'Password:'
            username: admin
        passwords:
            tacacs: admin
            enable: admin
            line: admin
        connections:
            defaults:
                class: 'unicon.Unicon'
            a:
                protocol: telnet
                ip: <ip address>            <<<<< FILL HERE
                port: <port>                <<<<< FILL HERE
        custom:
            abstraction:
                order: [os]
    csr1000v-1:
        type: asr1k
        os: "iosxe"
        alias: helper
        tacacs:
            login_prompt: 'login:'
            password_prompt: 'Password:'
            username: cisco
        passwords:
            tacacs: cisco
            enable: cisco
            line: cisco
        connections:
            defaults:
                class: 'unicon.Unicon'
            a:
                protocol: telnet
                ip: <ip address>            <<<<< FILL HERE
                port: <port>                <<<<< FILL HERE
        custom:
            abstraction:
                order: [os]
```
