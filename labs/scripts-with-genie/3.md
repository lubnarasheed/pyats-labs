## Step 3. Execute Genie script with Easypy


0. Run Docker container and activate your Python virtual environment inside it

```
# Run Docker container
docker run -it -v /genie_learning_labs:/genie_tests ciscotestautomation/pyats bash

# Once inside the Docker container, activate Python virtual environment
cd /pyats
source env.csh
```

Please note: This step is optional if you still have the Docker container launched in `intro-to-genie` lab [Step4]()


1. Create a new file genie_parsers.robot

```
cd genie_tests
touch genie_sample_job.py
touch mapping_datafile.yaml
```


2. Edit the file genie_sample_job.py and copy the code below into it

```python
'''
Sample Genie Job File
'''

# Author
__author__ = 'Cisco Systems Inc.'
__copyright__ = 'Copyright (c) 2018, Cisco Systems Inc.'
__contact__ = ['asg-genie-support@cisco.com']
__date__= 'June 2018'


# ATS & Genie
from ats.datastructures.logic import And, Not, Or
from genie.harness.main import gRun


def main(runtime):

    gRun(mapping_datafile='/genie_tests/mapping_datafile.yaml',
         trigger_uids=And('TriggerClearBgpNeighbor'),
         verification_uids=And('Verify_BgpAllNeighbors'),
         )

```


Take a few minutes to review the code above and note the following arguments:

- `gRun`: Launches Genie Harness to execute in sequence the common_setup, Global Verifications, Triggers, common_cleanup. 

- `mapping_datafile`: The mapping_datafile argument is simply a YAML file that is used by Genie Harness to identify which devices from the testbed YAML the script should connect to, as well as which communication protocol to use when connecting to the devices. See step #3 on how to create a mapping datafile YAML.

- `trigger_uids`: By default, all Triggers in `genie.libs.sdk` are available for execution using Genie Harness. The trigger_uids argument is used to specify which Triggers we would like to execute using Genie Harness.

- `verification_uids`: By default, all Verification developed in `genie.libs.sdk` are available for execution using Genie Harness. The verification_uids argument is used to specify which Verifications we would like to execute using Genie Harness before and after each Trigger.

3. Edit the file mapping_datafile.yaml and copy the code below into it

```yaml

devices:

  PE1:	<--- your device name
    context: cli
    label: uut
    mapping:
      cli: console
```

 Note the keys `context` and `mapping` in the YAML example above.


4. Execute the script using Easypy and view the tests execute on your terminal.

```
(pyats)$ easypy genie_sample_job.py -testbed_file /genie_tests/default_testbed.yaml -html_logs
```


## More Genie Examples

Genie comes with nine examples where each example demonstrates the flow of Genie and how it can be used in testing different features and frameworks. Navigate to the examples folder to peruse the sample scripts available to run:

```
(pyats)$ cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/examples/genie
(pyats)$ ls -l

```

Follow through the steps on the [Genie Examples](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/examples/example.html) documentation to execute each of the above tests.

> Note: The examples above can be executed on the same VIRL device that was launched in the "boot-genie-virl" lab.


#### Congratulations! You've Completed Scripts with Genie!
