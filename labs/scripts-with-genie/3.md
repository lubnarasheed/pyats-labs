# Step 3. Execute Genie script with Easypy

## Create a Sample Genie Job

1. Create a new jofile genie_sample_job.py and copy the code below into the file

```python
'''
Sample Genie Job File
'''

# Author
__author__ = 'Cisco Systems Inc.'
__copyright__ = 'Copyright (c) 2018, Cisco Systems Inc.'
__contact__ = ['asg-genie-support@cisco.com']
__date__= 'June 2018'


# ATS & Genie
from ats.datastructures.logic import And, Not, Or
from genie.harness.main import gRun


def main(runtime):

    gRun(mapping_datafile='/path/to/mapping_datafile.yaml',
         trigger_uids=And('TriggerClearBgpNeighbor'),
         verification_uids=And('Verify_BgpAllNeighbors'),
         )

```


2. Take a few minutes to review the code above and note the following arguments

- `gRun`: Launches Genie Harness to execute in sequence the common_setup, Global Verifications, Triggers, common_cleanup. 

- `mapping_datafile`: The mapping_datafile argument is simply a YAML file that is used by Genie Harness to identify which devices from the testbed YAML the script should connect to, as well as which communication protocol to use when connecting to the devices. See step #3 on how to create a mapping datafile YAML.

- `trigger_uids`: By default, all Triggers in `genie.libs.sdk` are available for execution using Genie Harness. The trigger_uids argument is used to specify which Triggers we would like to execute using Genie Harness.

- `verification_uids`: By default, all Verification developed in `genie.libs.sdk` are available for execution using Genie Harness. The verification_uids argument is used to specify which Verifications we would like to execute using Genie Harness before and after each Trigger.

3. Create a mapping_datafile.yaml

```yaml

devices:

  PE1:	<--- your device name
    context: cli
    label: uut
    mapping:
      cli: vty <--- vty or console
```

 Note the keys `context` and `mapping` in the YAML example above.

4. Execute the script using Easypy and view the tests execute on your terminal.

```
(pyenv) hostname$ easypy genie_sample_job.py -testbed_file /path/to/virl.yaml -html_logs
```

## More Genie Examples

Genie comes with nine examples where each example demonstrates the flow of Genie and how it can be used in testing different features and frameworks. Navigate to the examples folder to peruse the sample scripts available to run:

```
(pyenv) hostname$ cd ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/examples/genie
(pyenv) hostname$ ls -l

```

Follow through the steps on the [Genie Examples](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/examples/example.html) documentation to execute each of the above tests.

> Note: The examples above can be executed on the same VIRL device that was launched in the "boot-genie-virl" lab.

#### Congratulations! You've Completed Scripts with Genie!
